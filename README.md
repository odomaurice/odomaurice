- 👋 Hi, there!!! My name is Maurice

I'm a Fullstack web developer. And my love for invention and problem solving ushered me into the field of tech and quitting my previous discipline in philosophy which deals with the quest for knowledge and the application of such knowledge to all aspects of life. Science and Technology is an important aspect of our lives which promotes better modes of living by encouraging man to become an inventor not merely a user. In this field, I found what I've always wanted😊❤

What I've learnt so far:
📝 HTML
🎨 CSS
🏃‍♂️ JAVASCRIPT

Frameworks I've learnt:
✔ Bootstrap
✔ Jquery

Currently learning:
🤔 Node.js
🤔 PHP


I have experienced working with clients independently and collaboratively in various projects.

FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT, I'M MOSTLY ACTIVE ON TWITTER AND LINKEDIN😉
